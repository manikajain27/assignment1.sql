This project involves the design and implementation of a relational database system to manage the data of employees, departments, and projects in an organization. It includes data modeling, constraints, data manipulation, and advanced SQL queries for reporting and analysis.

ðŸ“‚ Database Tables & Descriptions
1. Department
Purpose: Stores department-related information.

Fields:

dept_id (INT, Primary Key): Unique identifier for each department.

dept_name (VARCHAR, UNIQUE, NOT NULL): Name of the department.

2. Employee
Purpose: Maintains employee personal and work-related details.

Fields:

emp_id (INT, Primary Key): Unique employee ID.

emp_name (VARCHAR, NOT NULL): Name of the employee.

email (VARCHAR, UNIQUE): Employee's unique email address.

salary (DECIMAL): Monthly salary (must be > 10,000).

dept_id (INT, Foreign Key): References Department.

hire_date (DATE): Date of hiring. Defaults to current date via a trigger.

Constraints & Triggers:

email must be unique.

salary must be greater than 10,000 (enforced via a trigger).

hire_date defaults to current date if not provided (trigger-based).

3. Project
Purpose: Holds project data managed by the organization.

Fields:

proj_id (INT, Primary Key): Unique project ID.

proj_name (VARCHAR, NOT NULL): Name of the project.

budget (DECIMAL): Project's allocated budget.

4. Employee_Project
Purpose: Junction table for many-to-many relationship between employees and projects.

Fields:

emp_id (Foreign Key): References Employee.

proj_id (Foreign Key): References Project.

assigned_date (DATE): Date the employee was assigned.

Constraints:

Composite Primary Key on (emp_id, proj_id) prevents duplicate assignments.

ðŸ“¤ Data Insertions (DML)
5 entries per table were inserted with meaningful data.

Data includes:

Employees with varied salaries, departments, and hire dates.

Projects with different budgets and scopes.

Relationships between employees and projects.

ðŸ§  SQL Features Used
âœ… Constraints & Integrity
Primary Keys and Foreign Keys

UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints

Triggers for enforcing business logic (default dates and salary validation)

âœ… Queries Implemented
Basic Queries:
Filter by salary, hire year, department name

Joins:
Retrieve employee & department data

List projects with or without employees

Find departments with no employees

Aggregations:
Calculate average salary by department

Count employees per department

Subqueries:
Compare salary to average

Find employees on more than 2 projects

UNION:
Combine employee names and project names into a single list

Advanced Queries (Extra Credit):
Highest paid employee per department

Employees not assigned to any project

Update salaries conditionally

Delete inactive employees (not assigned to any project in the last year)

ðŸ’» Technical Tools & Technologies
RDBMS: MySQL

IDE: MySQL Workbench / phpMyAdmin / VS Code

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Language: SQL (DDL, DML, Queries, Triggers)# assignment1.sql
